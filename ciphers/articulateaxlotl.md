In my prime, I was a sailor. I don't remember much, but… these flags. We used them to communicate between ships. Ah, I recall when they were first rolled out. I was working on a shipping boat, and… and… I don't know. Anyways, I have to go to my next shrine. Pay my respects. If anyone can find this, it'd be nice to have some company down the road.
